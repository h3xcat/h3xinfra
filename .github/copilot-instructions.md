Before making **any** changes (new files, major features, architecture decisions), ALWAYS ask clarifying questions about:
- Requirements and specifications
- Expected functionality and behavior  
- Integration points with existing systems
- Output formats and user interface
- Error handling and edge cases

Wait for confirmation of the approach before proceeding with implementation.
